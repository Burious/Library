2. There are CRUD operations, which can help you to interact with "Library".
3. The application has an authentication based on ASP.Net Identity + JWT.

5. Dependency Injection is also used.

Features:

2. Customize library for particular user(now all users see a common information, on the next step - each user will have it's own library)
